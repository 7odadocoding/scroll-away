# Scroll Away

Page Scrolling with Controlled Speed mainly made to use in my portfolio is a JavaScript-based project that provides a unique scrolling experience for landing pages. It allows users to navigate through pages in four different directions: top, bottom, right and left. The scrolling speed is controlled to ensure users have enough time to view the content of each page while scrolling.

## Known Bugs

- Scrolling to the top and left directions does not currently work as expected. This issue is being investigated and will be addressed in a future update.
